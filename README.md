Star Map [better name pending] is a 2D open world space game made in p5.js.
A lot of the game (or at least my plans for it) takes inspiration from games like Elite

this game will be unfinished for a while, theres not too much to do at the moment

this is the INDEV version.
this version is not garunteed to be stable and there may be several unfinished features

working on:
- making the code easier to work on
- implementing fuel usage and refueling
- implementing ship modules
- adding ship management menu
- adding lasers and mining
