STAR MAP FABRICATION OPTIMIZATION MODULE
(planning document)
(hopefully this should allow us to work better)

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: MODULE SCREEN

NEEDED FEATURES:
  - module selection buttons
    - should work similarly to commodity selection buttons
  - menu navigation buttons
    - again, we can probably just use the code from the commodity selection screens
  - module information
    - dump the text from the module's description onto the screen
    - get the price
  - installing modules onto the ship
    - check if the module can be installed (have enough money, enough space on the ship, module slot is big enough)
  - uninstalling modules
    - allow player to select module to remove
    - pay them a small amount of credits for the salvage
    - remove the module, and modify the ship however it needs to be modified (should be handled per module already)


TODO:
  - PRIORITY: debug/devtools, most importantly something to speed up making buttons and menus
  - add nebulas, the game needs to look pretty (also finish making stars)
  - more places to visit, likely asteroid fields first, but add other POIs too (shipwrecks? trading caravans? SOS beacons?)
  - OMFG SAVING YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THE DAMN GAME DO NOT FORGET this
  - lore??
  - a main menu and settings menu
  - mining
  - SFX (also pretty important)
  - more playable ships
  - improve ui visuals (they could look WAY cooler, just saying)
    - make the crazy-ass screens of your dreams
  - larger and more dynamic map (different resources, danger levels, factions?)
  - make movement fun (custom movement, less reliance on physics engine other than for collisions)
    - please I need to be able to drift the spaceship
    - also very much needed in order for the next thing to be fun
    - maybe make ship rotation controlled by the mouse
  - NPC ships and combat (difficult but necessary)
    - NPC ai
    - weapons (turrets and spinals)
  - more crafting
  - missions and interactable NPCs


ELABORATE:
  - debug/devtools, most importantly something to speed up making buttons and menus

  making menus and buttons is a pain in the ass,
  getting the correct coordinates and size for each one and manually adjusting the button function sucks.
  we need to make a tool that allows us to quickly get coordinates for a button using some sort of visual interface


  - add nebulae, the game needs to look pretty (also finish making stars)

  nebulae should be generated alongside the regular star map
  using perlin noise there would be three layers of nebulae
  three noise maps would be generated, one for R, G, and B seperately
  each of these would determine the transparency of the nebula colors
  there would be a high threshold to make sure that they don't generate everywhere
  the maps would be 2-3x larger than the star map, to improve the illusion that they are local to a few star systems
  also they would be slightly offset from each other to create a more interesting visual


  - more places to visit, likely asteroid fields first, but add other POIs too (shipwrecks? trading caravans? SOS beacons?)

  space is a bit boring right now, there isn't anywhere to go other than stations
  making it possible to visit asteroid belts would be a good start, as well as pave the way for mining
  adding random or even temporary POIs such as shipwrecks with salvageable loot or SOS beacons with a random events
  caravans could carry special items or deals


  - OMFG SAVING YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THE DAMN GAME DO NOT FORGET this

  this may or may not be a pain in the ass but it is 100% needed
  we can it in the browser chache
  we stuff all of the arrays and variables into one big table and the load it the same way
  either that or we try to compress it (no lol)


  - lore??

  this would help the game feel meaningful and also probably help our motivation while also giving us ideas for gameplay
  ?: can we put protogens in it
  sure, as long as you handle it appropriately
  we will need factions
  and some sort of plot driver
  who are we and why should we be doing anything


  - a main menu and settings menu

  having a main menu will make our game feel more polished,
